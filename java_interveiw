### Week 2 – Core Java + Collections

**Goal**: Use the **Collections Framework** and understand basic memory behavior.

**Topics**

1. **Collections Framework**【turn1search4】
   - `List` (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`), `Set` (`HashSet`), `Map` (`HashMap`).
   - When to use which; basic performance characteristics.

2. **Generics and basics**【turn1search1】
   - Why generics, type safety.
   - `List<String>`, `Map<String, Student>` etc.

3. **Exceptions & basic I/O**

  - Requirements, assumptions.
  - Core classes (`Elevator`, `Building`, `Request`, `Controller`).
  - Brief explanation of scheduling strategy.【turn3search0】【turn3search4】

---

### Week 8 – Mock Interviews + Polish

**Goal**: Turn knowledge into **interview performance**.

**What to do**

1. **Mock interviews**
   - Do at least **3–4 full mocks**:
     - 45–60 mins coding (one problem).
     - 30–45 mins Spring / Java Q&A.
     - 15–20 mins system design / LLD.

2. **Resume & story**
   - Write a one-page resume highlighting:
     - Java 17–25, Spring Boot 4, REST, JPA, basic security.
     - Your projects (with links to GitHub).
   - Prepare a 2–3 minute “story” about each project.

3. **Country-specific notes**
   - For **USA/UK**: expect stronger focus on DSA, system design, and clean code.
   - For **Kuwait/UAE**: often more practical Spring + SQL + basic DSA, but it varies by company.

---

## 3. How to Use This Plan Without Getting Overwhelmed

1. **Don’t research everything at once.**
   Follow the weekly order. Only go deep into external resources when a topic shows up in that week.

2. **Each day, focus on:**
   - 1 concept at a time.
   - 1–2 coding exercises.
   - 1 small commit in your project.

3. **Adjust speed**:
   - If you have 6–8 weeks → stick to 1 week per block.
   - If you only have 4 weeks → compress:
     - W1–W2 into 1 week.
     - W3–W4 into 1 week.
     - W5–W8 into 2–3 weeks.

---

If you tell me how many weeks you realistically have (e.g., “I have exactly 6 weeks” or “I can do 8 weeks”), I can turn this into a **concrete day-by-day checklist** with specific tasks and links to exercises.

PHASE 1:

Based on the search results, I have synthesized the key information to build your **Phase 1: Java Foundation** plan. I used the "divide and conquer" method by separating the research into three specific areas: **Modern Java 25 Features**, **Core Learning Roadmaps**, and **Topic-Specific Resources**.

Here is what I learned and how it shapes your Phase 1 plan:

### 1. The "Game Changer" for Beginners (Java 25)
I discovered that **Java 25 introduces specific features designed to eliminate the traditional complexity of starting Java**. This is critical for your "3x speed" goal.
*   **Feature:** **Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods (JEP 512)** 【turn0search10】【turn0search11】.
*   **Why it matters:** Historically, you had to write `public static void main(String[] args)` inside a `public class` just to print "Hello World". Java 25 allows you to write code much more simply, similar to Python or Kotlin, to get started.
*   **Action:** We will use this to bypass the "boilerplate barrier" so you can focus purely on logic and syntax in the first 48 hours.

### 2. The Standard "Industry Roadmap"
I cross-referenced the **roadmap.sh Java Developer Roadmap** and a **Java SDET Roadmap** to confirm the standard industry progression 【turn0search3】【turn0search5】.
*   **The Consensus Order:** The industry agrees on this sequence:
    1.  **Syntax & Basics:** Variables, Data Types, Control Flow (Loops, If/Else).
    2.  **OOP Fundamentals:** Classes, Objects, Methods.
    3.  **Core Data Structures:** Arrays, Lists, Maps (Collections).
    4.  **Exception Handling:** Try-Catch blocks.
*   **Action:** We will follow this exact order but compress the timeline.

### 3. Key Resources for "Expert Faking"
I found concise "cheat sheets" and deep dives that will help you sound like an expert quickly 【turn0search1】【turn0search4】.
*   **OOP Deep Dive:** Resources like GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools break down OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism) into digestible chunks 【turn0search0】【turn0search1】.
*   **Collections & Exceptions:** I found specific cheat sheets that summarize the most critical interview topics (Lists, Sets, Maps, Try-Catch) into one page 【turn0search4】.

---

### **Phase 1 Plan: The Java Foundation (Days 1-6)**

This phase is designed to take you from "Zero" to "I can write basic logic and structure" in 6 days.

#### **Days 1-2: The "Easy Start" & Core Logic**
*   **Goal:** Write running code immediately.
*   **Modern Approach (Java 25):** Start with **Implicitly Declared Classes** (no `public class` needed) and **Instance Main Methods** (no `static void main` needed).
*   **Topics:**
    *   Variables & Data Types (int, double, boolean, String).
    *   Operators (+, -, *, /, %).
    *   Control Flow: `if-else`, `switch` (modern syntax), `for` loops, `while` loops.

#### **Days 3-4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
*   **Goal:** Understand how to structure code using "Blueprints".
*   **Topics:**
    *   **Classes vs Objects:** The difference between a blueprint and a house.
    *   **The 4 Pillars of OOP:** You *must* be able to explain these in an interview:
        1.  **Encapsulation:** Protecting data (getters/setters).
        2.  **Inheritance:** Reusing code (`extends` keyword).
        3.  **Polymorphism:** One interface, many forms.
        4.  **Abstraction:** Hiding complexity (Interfaces/Abstract classes).

#### **Days 5-6: Data Handling & Safety**
*   **Goal:** Store data and handle errors (Critical for Backend).
*   **Topics:**
    *   **Arrays:** Fixed-size data storage.
    *   **Collections Framework (Basics):** `ArrayList` (dynamic lists), `HashMap` (key-value pairs). *You will use these daily as a backend dev.*
    *   **Exception Handling:** `try`, `catch`, `finally`. Why crashes happen and how to prevent them.
